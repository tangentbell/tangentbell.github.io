      Hi! I go by tangent(bell) online and Iâ€™m currently a student of computer science. Despite my kind of boring career
      path, I've long been an artist and musician and I love creating things. It's been my wish since I was a little
      kid to make my own games, cartoons, comics... really just anything that could express the mess of ideas in my head.
      Until recently that all felt like a pipe dream. I've never been that talented at anything, and I'm still not; I've
      kind of spread my interests too thin and thus while I'm adequate at many different things, I'm not particularly
      skilled in any one area. Still, I've found myself in a position where I can actually materialize my ideas, and
      I couldn't be more excited to share them with the world!<br><br>
      Anyway, here's the obligatory list of my favorite things: my favorite food is green grapes, my favorite color is
      teal, my favorite game is Fallout 2, my favorite band is Depeche Mode, my favorite manga is Dorohedoro, and my
      biggest artistic inspiration is Teppei Fukushima.<br><br>
      I'm always happy to make new friends, so if you want to talk about video games, languages, manga or whatever, my
      Discord handle is @tangentbell.
