      Welcome to my website! Here you can find links to my various projects and art galleries. Its frontend is hosted
      on GitHub Pages with a .NET backend hosted on Fly.io, and databases/S3 buckets provided by AWSâ€”it's a pretty cheap
      setup if you're looking for a personal website solution!<br><br>
      A little about me, I'm a software engineer with a passion for graphic design, music production and teaching. I
      hope to use my skills to make a positive change in the world while also leaving enough time for my game projects,
      manga translation and story ideas. I love old sci-fi shows, tokusatsu, studying languages and playing video games
      (though I don't really have time for that last one nowadays). Hopefully you'll find something interesting on this
      site!<br><br>
      If you ever want to chat, my Discord is @tangentbell.
